1. - Suppose we have the following array.
var persons=[{"id":1,"firstName":"John","lastName":"Smith","dateOfBirth":"1978-01-28"},{"id":2,"firstName":"Mary","lastName":"Hernandez","dateOfBirth":"1975-02-19"},.....];

Write a JavaScript function that returns an array with the full name of the person and the age. You can create auxiliary functions. Make the code as modular as possible.

[{"id":1,"fullName":"John Smith","age":38},{"id":2,"fullName":"Mary Hernandez","age":41},.....]
